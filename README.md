# Font-Generator-for-Hoca-Watch

I have created the necessary software which will turn the BMP images into FONT structs. Those structs we created are then used as fonts in the smart watch.

**APOLOGY**

I have created this piece of software overnight. I had to write it quickly so I did not comment anything. I will go back and comment every bit of code when I have the time.
